        It's been minified for the browser so that it will work a little bit more quickly. 
        And then the other thing that we need to do, we're still noticing if I refresh 
        this that we have that syntax error, the thing we need to do to fix this is instead 
        of using text javascript, we need to use text/babel. 
        Babel is going to go through any of the script tags that have text Babel and 
        it's going to transform any of these tags that don't work in the browser to those 
        create element calls that do.
