        As our user interface becomes more complex, as we have more createElement calls on the page, 
        our code starts to get a little hectic. And by that I just mean that every single element that 
        I would need to create has to have its own createElement call. 
        So what we want is some sort of a helper, some sort of a syntax to come fix this for us 
        and that helper is called JSX. 
        JSX or JavaScript as XML is an HTML-like syntax for creating UI elements.
