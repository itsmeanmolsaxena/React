  <!-- ReactDom.render is one of the most important functions in the react Dom library. 
    It's going to take in two different arguments. 
    The first of the arguments that we'll send to this function is react.createelement. 
    And we're going to use this to create an element to add to the page. 
    Instead of using, "<h1>Getting Started with React</h1>" here I want to create the same thing using react. 
    So we'll say h1 is the type of element I want to create. 
    Null is the second argument that will pass here because we don't want to pass any properties 
    to this element. 
    And then finally, we want to mimic the h1 fully by writing getting started with react. -->
  <body>
      <div id="root"></div>
      
      <script type="text/javascript">
          ReactDOM.render(
              React.createElement("h1", null, "Getting Started!"),
              document.getElementById("root")
          );
      </script>
  </body>
  <!-- So to reactDom.render, we're sending two things. 
    The first is the element we want to create. The second is where we want to put this. 
    So we're saying, take this element and put it right here inside of the div. -->
